# Project R7D6
Autonomous robot (R7D6) which uses a combination of infrared emitting diodes, fixed position infared recievers, and ultrasonic distance sensors to map the space and navigate around obstacles. The project will also feature a remote operator control console (OCC) that allows an operator to inhibit R7D6's motion. Communication will be achieved using a mixture of Bluetooth and RF. All controllers will be in constant communication with a wayside controller which will give the operator the ability to view the status of R7D6, messages, and manually control R7D6.

This project is currently in development, as pieces are finished they will be publicly available here.
